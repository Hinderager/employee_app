# PWA Icons TODO

The manifest.json requires two icon files:
- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

These should be the Top Shelf logo on a yellow background (#FFC845).

You can use an online tool like:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

Or create them manually in any image editor.

For now, the app will work without these, but they're needed for a complete PWA experience.
